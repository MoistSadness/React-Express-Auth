# About
I created this application learn how to use React Router and user Authentication without having to mess around with any of the projects I actually care about. 

There very minimal CSS in this application because the idea is to create a ready to use template that I can reuse in other projects. Adding too much now would lead to alot of copying and deleting in the future.

# Authentication
Authentication done by following the following tutorial: 
registration - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brcHK3P6ChQ
login - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3qyxo_UTR4
backend/creating tokens - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EqECiTBL8

One thing I never considered is how to implement code in React that is accessible to screen readers. Accessibility concerns are something I have ignored until this point because it comes off as being too much work.
